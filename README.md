# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Analysis - Data Science Capstone

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone. It explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records to answer key questions and build a classification model to predict launch success.

## 📊 Project Structure

- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis using matplotlib and seaborn.
- `SQL_Queries.ipynb`: Data querying using SQL with key insights.
- `Folium_Map.ipynb`: Interactive geographical maps using Folium.
- `Dash_App.py`: Interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash.
- `classification_model.ipynb`: Classification model development and evaluation.
- `presentation.pdf`: Final project presentation slides.

## 🔍 Main Objectives

- Explore launch success rates by site and orbit.
- Analyze payload trends over time.
- Build a predictive model to estimate launch success.
- Visualize outcomes using interactive maps and dashboards.
